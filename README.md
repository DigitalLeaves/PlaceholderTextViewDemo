There is a full tutorial on how to build your custom IBDesignable controls for XCode6 [here](http://digitalleaves.com/blog/building-your-custom-ibdesignable-controls-and-views/)

## Usage

Just drag & drop the file PlaceholderTextView.swift into your project. Then in the Interface Builder, add a UITextView to any of your UIViewControllers. Click on the Identity Inspector (the icon that looks like an id card or a user profile page on the utilities right panel). Write "PlaceholderTextView" in the "Class" field, and you are ready! 

Use the Attribute Inspector to change the placeholder text and color.
